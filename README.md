## What is IDP?

IDP is an open source data science IDE with strong support for Python & SQL language, code assistance, file and environment management.
IDP is designed for data scientists, algorithm engineers and big data engineers to maximize working efficiency all through the AI development process.
Written in Rust, IDP exhibits excellent performance and security. 

## Key Features of IDP
IDP aims to help data scientists and algorithm engineers focus more on algorithm development by taking care of all the engineering work, from environment and file management to plug-in development and configuration, etc..

The core features of IDP are as follows:
* Multi-language: deeply support Python, SQL and Markdown lanageguage in the same notebook.
* Data visualization: generating data insights directly using in-built data visualization tools, e.g.,bar charts, scatterplots, line charts, etc..
* Automatic versioning: automatic tracking and managing of code changes; clear and convenient version comparison. 
* Coding assistance: powerful coding assistance functions including  intelligent code completion , hovor, diagnostic and quickfix.
* Package manager: search and manage common data science packages easily and efficiently.
* Variable manager: interactively browse and manage variables and conveniently compare different algorithm approaches and parameter settings.
* Managing environment: conveniently cloning a Python/system environment for reuse to avoid tedious repeated configuration.
